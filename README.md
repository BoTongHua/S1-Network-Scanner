# S1-Network-Scanner
Simple network scanner was created using python3 and can be used exclusively for educational purposes. The tool takes an ip range with network mask as an argument, searches for online hosts in the network and returns their local ip address with MAC addresses.

Usage:
  ```
  python3 -r [network_ip]/[mask]
  python3 --range [network_ip]/[mask]
  ```
